## GitHub info

### All codes for the GitHub must be punched into the TERMINAL and not into the CONSOLE

1.  Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your terminal or RStudio terminal and navigate to the local directory where your R code is stored.

cd C:\Users\morte\Documents\Skole\Spring 2024\BIO 415\Testing Github

2.  Initialize Git (if not already done): If your project directory is not already a Git repository, you need to initialize it.

git init

3.  Link Your GitHub Repository: Add the GitHub repository as the "remote" to your local project.

git remote add origin <https://github.com/morten051998/Model-1.git>

4.  Add Your Files to Git: Use git add to add all your files (or specify particular files if you don't want to add everything).

git add "Module 1 Notebook AndreassenM.Rmd"

5.  Commit Your Changes: Use a descriptive commit message to commit your changes.

git commit -m "Initial commit: Uploading R scripts"

6.  Push Your Code to GitHub: Push your committed changes to the GitHub repository.

git push -u origin master

- To finish the commit in Vim:

- Press "i" to go into insert mode (if you want to edit the commit message).

- You can modify the commit message if you'd like, or leave it as is.
Once you're done, press "Esc" to exit insert mode.

- Type ":wq" (which means "write and quit") and press Enter.

- This will save the commit message and exit Vim, finalizing the merge commit.

7. After exiting Vim, Git will complete the commit for the merge. Once that is done, you can proceed to push the changes to the remote repository using:

git push origin master

# Getting Started with Module 1

## Use of "\#" and {r}

More "\#" gives more subheadings

In the {r} command (ctrl+alt+i) you can choose to exclude the code from your text using include=False so it looks like this {r, include=False} for data that is not to important include. You can also name the chunks {r, Mean_temp} so you can make it more easy to know what the code does.

Nice to know commands - Use the pipe command ctrl + shift + M = %\>%

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

rm(list = ls())

```

# Load the needed packages

```{r Tidyverse}

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
